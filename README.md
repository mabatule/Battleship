# Battleship game ðŸš¢
## Description
Battleship is a war-themed board game for two players in which the opponents try to guess the location of their opponent's warships and sink them. A paper and pencil version of the game dates back to World War I, but most people are familiar with the game through the plastic board game that was first marketed by the Milton Bradley Company in 1967. Since then, the game has spawned various video games and smartphone app variations. Today, the board game version is produced by Hasbro, the company that acquired Milton Bradley in 1984. 

The gameplay is straightforward. Each player hides ships on a plastic grid containing vertical and horizontal space coordinates. Players take turns calling out row and column coordinates on the other player's grid in an attempt to identify a square that contains a ship. 

Each player receives a game board and five **boats** of different lengths. Each boat has squares where a hit can be made. The five boats are:

 Carrier, which has five squares.
 Battleship, which has four squares.
 Cruiser, which has one box.
 Submarine, which has three boxes.
 Destroyer, which has two boxes.
